\section{Preliminaries}

The exam consists of 4 questions: two on algorithms and geometry and two on cryptography, each worth 25 pts. Anything above 75 pts will be considered a perfect score, which you may achieve by solving any combination of the problems (e.g. if you do perfectly on the first two, and only get half the last two, that's still 75 pts).

You are allowed to use the lecture notes. When helpful, you should refer to the typed lecture in your answers, but make sure to give precise references (e.g. [Lecture 3, Section 2, Lemma 4]). If the Lemma/Theorem in question contains several statements, please explicitly state which one you are using.

\section{Algorithms}
