Geometric Functional Analysis & its Applications

        The geometry of convex bodies in high dimensions and correspondingly of 
normed vectors spaces is a beautiful subject of study that has 
fascinated mathematicians for over a hundred years. Questions that have 
driven the field include: how does measure concentrate in high 
dimensions? how close is every convex body to an ellipsoid? how much can 
one improve upon on the triangle inequality? To what extent does the 
parallelogram law hold? To gain a deep understanding of these questions, 
still today the subject of very active research, powerful techniques 
were developed by leveraging surprising connections between geometry, 
analysis and probability. These have now found numerous applications 
across mathematics and computer science. In particular, a rich interplay 
of continuous and discrete mathematics has developed in recent years.

The aim of this course is to both cover the fundamentals of the area as 
well as selected applications.
        
Possible fundamental topics include:
- the geometry of normed spaces
- sums of Banach space valued random variables
- the concepts of type and cotype
- embeddings into l_2 and l_1
- Grothendieck's inequality
- functional inequalities such as Prekopa-Leindler and Brescamp-Lieb
- isoperimetric inequalities and logconcave measures.

Possible application areas include:
- algorithms for volume estimation
- combinatorial discrepancy
- spectral graph theory
- error correcting codes
- etc.

Prerequisites:

The main prerequisite is mathematical maturity. However, we will assume 
the students are comfortable with / can quickly pick up the basic 
concepts in:

1. Linear algebra: vector & dual vector spaces, determinants, gram 
schmidt orthogonalization, etc.

2. Basic Convexity: duality, separation results, polar of convex sets, 
norms, dual norms, etc.

3. Probability & Probabilistic algorithms: Gaussians, Chernoff bounds, 
Monte Carlo algorithms. For some useful lectures notes, see:
